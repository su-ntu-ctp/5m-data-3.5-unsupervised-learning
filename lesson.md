# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation

We will be using the `ml` environment for this lesson.

### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we will be learning about unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. We will learn about outlier and anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction and clustering.

## Part 1 - Unsupervised Learning

We will be using the `notebooks/unsupervised_learning_lesson.ipynb` notebook throughout this lesson.

> 1. Activate the environement `conda activate ml`.
> 2. Run `jupyter notebook`.
> 3. In the notebook, open `notebooks/unsupervised_learning_lesson.ipynb`.
> 4. Follow on with the lesson in the notebook.
