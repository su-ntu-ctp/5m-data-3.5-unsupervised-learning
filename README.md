# 3.5 Unsupervised Learning

## Dependencies

Refer to the following markdown file for the respective sections of the class:

- [Self Studies](./studies.md)
- [Lesson](./lesson.md)
- [Assignment](./assignment.md)
- [Quiz](./quiz.md)
- [Reference](./reference.md)

## Lesson Objectives

Learners will understand:

- What are outliers and anomalies and how to detect them
- Dimensionality reduction techniques
- Clustering techniques

Learners will be able to:

- Detect outliers and anomalies
- Perform dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of features
- Perform clustering to group similar data points together
