# Self Studies

## Brief

In this lesson, we will be learning about unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. We will learn about outlier and anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction and clustering.
